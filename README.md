This project implements a 2D to 3D conversion that transforms 2D images into 3D models using advanced computer vision techniques. By leveraging deep learning algorithms for depth estimation and reconstruction, the tool produces accurate and detailed 3D representations from 2D inputs. Key functionalities include depth estimation, 3D model generation, and an interactive UI for ease of use. The project is built using Python, with TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning, OpenCV for image processing, and the Blender API for 3D model creation. This tool is ideal for users looking to convert flat images into dynamic 3D models.
